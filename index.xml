      <description>Hacking 3 Days @ IDiAL, FH-Dortmund, for Eclipse Kuksa Features 13 Hackers met in Dortmund on August, 28th until 30th of August to work on an end-to-end use case scenario along with new Eclipse Kuksa technologies. 20 CQs, 2 major GitHub pull-requests, and 21035 LOCs were the results. Of course, the LOCs also contain content from work prior to the Hackathon.
More precisely, the Eclipse Kuksa Appstore was migrated to an Eclipse HawkBit Server, that transmits applications wirelessly to an Eclipse HawkBit client running on a device (Raspberry Pi) that runs the Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux + Kuksa technologies).</description>

      <description>EclipseCon France 2018 Eclipse Kuksa was presented at EclipseCon France 2018 along with the research booth, the research community&amp;rsquo;s pitch session, a regular talk hold by Tobias Rawald and Robert Hoettger, and an interview about the motivation, goals, and the current state of Eclipse Kuksa.
We really enjoyed hosting @EclipseCon France these neat research projects and their representatives @Appstacle @agile_iot @AMASSproject @crossminer @gemocinitiative @stamp_project. We are looking forward for meeting at @EclipseCon Europe!</description>

      <description>The Rover (SW: Rover Software, HW: Rover Hardware) has been updated to version V03. This includes several migrations of tasks to AGL services and applications, as well major improvements to the Rover&amp;rsquo;s chassis, that provides a more modular structure since components can be flexibly clipped to different positions without the need of screws. The following implementations are though on our roadmap for the next release:

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;
Because today&#39;s software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;
The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

      <description>Project Meeting in Oulanka At the project meeting in Oulanka, Finnland, the APPSTACLE consortium collected and coordinated a variety of topics to work on in the upcoming time. Use-case scenarios, in-vehicle development activities, network protocols, cloud infrastructure, security demands, dissemination and exploitation and other topics were in focus for the project partners. The various discussions, cooperations, ideas, and further activities were defined in order to set the basis to reach the goals of APPSTACLE and form Eclipse Kuksa, i.</description>
