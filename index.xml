      <description>Fraunhofer IESE brings flexible manufacturing to companies with Eclipse BaSyx. One of the goals of industry 4.0 is to be able to exchange devices with the same capabilities in a production plant without having to change the control system. The BaSys 4.0 project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, aims to solve this challenge in a practical way with the concept of service-based manufacturing. With the help of the Eclipse BaSyx, Fraunhofer IESE from Kaiserslautern and other project partners enable even small and medium-sized companies to make convertible manufacturing a reality.</description>

      <description>What is BaSyx Eclipse BaSyx is the open source platform for next generation automation. It implements key concepts defined by Platform Industrie 4.0, such as the Asset Administration Shell as standardized digital twin. Our mission is to provide a free software platform that enables all interested parties, large and small companies, research institutes, academia, and interested persons, to participate in and to shape the fourth industrial revolution. We believe that the availability of a free reference technology platform is a key success factor for the Industrie 4.</description>

      <description>Digital Twins with Asset Administration Shells  Eclipse BaSyx uses the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as base technology for digital twins. The AAS is the digital identity of an asset and links to AAS sub models that provide asset specific information, simulation models, and services. Eclipse BaSyx supports three kinds of sub models. The same AAS may link to any number of each kind:
 Static sub models provide access to data that only changes seldomly, such as documents, electronic certificates, data sheets, and digital name plates.</description>

      <description>End-to-End Digitization End-to-end digitization integrates all assets into one virtual space. It realizes a holistic digital twin that covers all kinds of assets – for example devices, products, and processes. This enables virtualization and optimization of individual assets, manufacturing plants, and whole supply chains.
Lot Size 1 Production Changes in automation processes requires developers to adapt PLC programs, MES components, and requires the testing of all changes. Every problem that occurs delays the re-start of a production line, and is therefore highly expensive.</description>

      <description>Digital Twins Digital Twins are complete representations of any physical or non-physical real-world asset. They represent the current state of the asset though a harmonized interface, which covers for example the state of an asset, and sensor values. Digital twins also provide simulation models that predict asset behavior in a particular situation, provide evidences for substantiated decisions, and enable what-if analysis.
The Asset Administration shell is an agreed technical foundation for digital twins.</description>

      <description>Making the Industry 4.0 happen requires great efforts and strong cooperation between research, academia, industry, the public, and standardization bodies. And it requires an implementation – the code that runs the world of manufacturing. Eclipse BaSyx emerged as commonly used Industry 4.0 middleware and became one of the first implementations of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), even before it was a standard for digital twins. This is why Eclipse BaSyx is part of the code that enables digitization of manufacturing – that connects machines and IT systems – that runs our world.</description>
