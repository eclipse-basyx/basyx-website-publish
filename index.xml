      <description>Eclipse BaSyx is the open source platform for next generation automation. It&#39;s implementing the key concepts defined by Platform Industrie 4.0, such as the Asset Administration Shell. Our mission is to provide a free software platform that enables all interested parties, large and small industries, research institutes, academia, and interested persons, to participate and to shape the fourth industrial revolution. We believe that the availability of a free reference technology platform is a key success factor for the Industrie 4.</description>

      <description>Hacking 3 Days @ IDiAL, FH-Dortmund, for Eclipse Kuksa Features 13 Hackers met in Dortmund on August, 28th until 30th of August to work on an end-to-end use case scenario along with new Eclipse Kuksa technologies. 20 CQs, 2 major GitHub pull-requests, and 21035 LOCs were the results. Of course, the LOCs also contain content from work prior to the Hackathon.
More precisely, the Eclipse Kuksa Appstore was migrated to an Eclipse HawkBit Server, that transmits applications wirelessly to an Eclipse HawkBit client running on a device (Raspberry Pi) that runs the Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux + Kuksa technologies).</description>

      <description>The Rover (SW: Rover Software, HW: Rover Hardware) has been updated to version V03. This includes several migrations of tasks to AGL services and applications, as well major improvements to the Rover&amp;rsquo;s chassis, that provides a more modular structure since components can be flexibly clipped to different positions without the need of screws. The following implementations are though on our roadmap for the next release:
 ACC Parking Marker recognition (using OpenCV) Rover-follow application &amp;hellip;.</description>
